Below are some of UHU\u2019s major accomplishments in this area:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"lst-kix_list_27-0 start\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>In 2017 we <a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/archives\/tag\/irpin-military-hospital\">began working with the Irpin Military Hospital<\/a> to provide rehabilitative equipment for the hospital&#8217;s recently opened department of amputee rehabilitation and provided $4,550 worth of equipment, such as a dynamic step trainer, stomach acidity measuring device, and walking bars.<\/li>\n<li>UHU covered \u201cextra luggage\u201d costs and supplies ($427) for shipping of at least 10 suitcases of medical supplies with people travelling to Ukraine. Each suitcase contained 50 pounds of medical supplies with monetary value ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 per suitcase. Medical supplies were donated to United Help Ukraine by the <a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/archives\/tag\/brothers-brother-foundation\">Brother\u2019s Brother Foundation<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Raising Awareness initiative\u00a0was extremely busy in 2017. UHU hosted\u00a0or took part in 28 events, fundraisers, and protests. Please see\u00a0below a full list of events.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, we want to draw your attention to\u00a0UHU\u2019s\u00a0administrative costs\u00a0and\u00a0our\u00a0continued commitment to operating at a minimum administrative costs margin. UHU\u2019s 2017 administrative and organizational fees totaled $2,295, which included: liability insurance ($1,270) we are required to carry to hold public events, such as concerts and fundraisers; website hosting fees; PayPal fees ($305), checks, postage, PO Box annual fee and other miscellaneous items. With the exception of PayPal fees, which we have no control over, all administrative expenses were covered by the UHU\u00a0membership fees\u00a0that totaled\u00a0$2,105. This means that <strong>none of the donated funds were used to cover UHU&#8217;s operation costs in 2017<\/strong>. We want to say a special thank you to our members and numerous volunteers who donate their time and talents to our organization&#8217;s cause. \u00a0<strong>Only because of patriots like you are we able to operate at such a margin and continue to raise funds and awareness to benefit Ukraine and her brave men and women.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We sincerely thank every one of you for trusting our judgment and supporting our initiatives during the past year, as well as prior years. It is only with your generous support that we were able to help so many in need during this difficult time. We continue to work only with trusted volunteers, and they are our direct link to recipients of our humanitarian aid. Our recipients are immensely grateful for your support; they are amazed and deeply touched every time they hear that more aid is coming from so far away. It means so much to all of them to know that people who have never met them and who live at such a great distance truly care about them and about Ukraine, and continuously strive to help them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As we enter 2018, we will continue all of our initiatives, including providing first aid kits which are still needed at the front lines, supporting the wounded warriors, as their number continues to grow, and helping children who have lost a family member in Russia\u2019s war in Eastern Ukraine. We strongly believe that every single person can make a difference, whether it is by providing financial support, writing a thank you letter to a soldier defending Ukraine, or by spreading a word of truth about Ukraine and the current situation there. We ask and hope for your continued support of our initiatives in the near future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">United Help Ukraine hosted or took part in the following 28 events,
