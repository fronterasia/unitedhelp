With the start of New Year 2016, we write to provide you an update of our major activities in 2015. First and foremost, we raised $103,001 in 2015, a tremendous accomplishment during these uncertain economic times. In total, from the date we established UHU in June 2014, we have raised a sum of $179,146. We owe UHU\u2019s success to your generosity and dedication of our volunteers.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, UHU had four major initiatives: distributing medical aid to hospitals and the wounded; providing life-saving medical supplies to Ukrainian warriors; providing humanitarian aid to internally displaced people and the families of Ukrainian defenders; and facilitating community involvement, to include participation in cultural events that raise awareness about Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to our group of dedicated volunteers, our <a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/our-focus\/medical-supplies_blog\/\"><strong>Medical Aid<\/strong><\/a> initiative was very effective this year. Below are some of UHU\u2019s major accomplishments in this area:<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; UHU shipped a 40-foot container with 20 pallets of medical supplies estimated value of <strong>$250,000.<\/strong> Medical supplies were donated by Brother\u2019s Brother Foundation and UHU paid $4,600 for shipping and a $2,500 processing fee;<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; UHU purchased a <strong>3D scanner<\/strong> costing $20,000 that will be delivered to a rehabilitation clinic in Kyiv that treats wounded Ukrainian warriors free of charge;<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; UHU raised over <strong>$5,500<\/strong> toward the treatment of wounded Ukrainian warriors;<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; UHU covered shipping costs for over <strong>20 suitcases<\/strong> of medical supplies with people traveling to Ukraine (each suitcase contained 50 lbs of medical supplies with value ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 each; medical supplies were donated by Brother\u2019s Brother Foundation); and<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; UHU provided constant support to wounded Ukrainian soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD.<\/p>\n<p>As part of our <strong>Medical Aid<\/strong> initiative, we started a \u201cT-shirt drive\u201d to provide socks, undergarments and t-shirts to the wounded at Ukrainian hospitals. We collected over 20 boxes of new items. Later in 2015, after we shipped an entire container of t-shirts to Ukraine, the \u201cT-shirt drive\u201d was converted to a \u201cSocks and Underwear Drive\u201d for the front line defenders. These everyday items are essential to preventing infections and avoiding the spread of disease in crowded hospitals.<\/p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/our-focus\/wounded-warrior_blog\/\"><strong>Defenders Aid<\/strong><\/a> initiative during 2015 sent:<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; Over 300 fully assembled first aid kits, 1,325 packs of QuikClot Z- Folded Gauzes and CELOX (blood-clotting medicine), 370 CATs (Combat Application Tourniquets), 500 Israeli Bandages,\u201d 5 Tasmanian tiger First Responder Backpacks, and a lot of other first aid medicine;<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; Shipped over 200 pair of boots and protective clothing to Ukrainian defenders with the total cost of over $12,000.<\/p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/our-focus\/humanitarian-aid_blog\/\"><strong>Humanitarian Aid<\/strong><\/a> initiative was also productive:<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; Held five large sorting\/packing events and many smaller non-official ones; during those events we packaged and shipped over <strong>25,399 lbs<\/strong> (or <strong>11.5 tons<\/strong>) of clothes, medicine, and bed sheets (total since UHU was created is 33,517 lbs);<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; All these items were packed into <strong>606 boxes<\/strong> (since UHU was established we packed over 838 boxes). Each box can hold enough clothes for 4-6 kids or 2-3 adults. We estimate we were able to help about 2,000 people and provide linens for 1,500 beds in Ukrainian hospitals; and<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; Shipped aid to over <strong>15 cities and villages<\/strong> in Ukraine and paid <strong>$14,516<\/strong> for shipping (total shipping costs for humanitarian aid initiative since UHU was created is <strong>$19,433<\/strong>).<\/p>\n<p>Also we received a donation of two 24-foot trucks filled with new t-shirts and hoodies. United Help Ukraine held 4 sorting and packing events to pack all these donated items, which totaled <strong>468 boxes<\/strong> after packing. The entire container of these t-shirts and hoodies was shipped to Ukraine for free.<\/p>\n<p>Also, as a part of our <strong>Humanitarian Aid<\/strong> initiative, we started a drive to collect toys through Amazon.com for Christmas presents to Ukrainian warriors&#8217; children. We received toy donations valued at <strong>over $3,000<\/strong> and they were distributed to 47 kids in Brody and children of Battalion Donbas defenders, and to over 35 kids in an orphanage in Odessa, Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>United Help Ukraine either hosted, organized or participated in over 35 events, fundraisers, and protests in 2015. Some of the most memorable events are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; Charity Concert by Gerdan to Commemorate the Fallen Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred at the Ukrainian Embassy held on February 20th (approximately $5,300 raised);<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666;
