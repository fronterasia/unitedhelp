Because of your generosity, 2016 proved to be another productive year. First and foremost, with your support we helped a considerable number of people and we are grateful to you for helping us raise $88,296 in 2016 toward that important work. This sum brings the amount of funds raised since United Help Ukraine&#8217;s establishment in June 2014 to a total of $245,140.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In 2016, UHU focused its efforts on the following four major initiatives:\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/our-focus\/medical-supplies_blog\/\">Medical Aid<\/a>,<\/strong>\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/our-focus\/wounded-warrior_blog\/\">Defenders Aid<\/a>,<\/strong>\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/our-focus\/humanitarian-aid_blog\/\">Humanitarian Aid<\/a>,<\/strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/our-focus\/raising-awareness_blog\/\">Raising Awareness<\/a>.<\/strong>\u00a0Please note that program spending reflected in this letter are shown only for delivered and finalized projects. Our total project spending in 2016 was less than total funds raised $88,296, because we received large donations at the end of December 2016. These funds were immediately put into our ongoing and new projects to deliver additional aid to Ukraine and we will provide reports after they are finalized.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Our\u00a0<strong>Medical Aid<\/strong>\u00a0initiative projects were very effective this year and accounted for\u00a0<strong>$23,693<\/strong>\u00a0of the total funds raised<strong>.<\/strong>\u00a0Below are some of UHU\u2019s major accomplishments in this area:<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; A 3D scanner (purchased in 2015) was delivered to the rehabilitation clinic \u2018Nodus\u2019 in Kyiv and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/tag\/3d\/\">is utilized by Ukrainian doctors in their treatments of soldiers<\/a>, including both drafted and volunteer warriors.<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; UHU shipped its second 40-foot container to Ukraine with 20 pallets of medical supplies. The supplies were donated by the Brother\u2019s Brother Foundation and were distributed to various hospitals in Ukraine, with a special focus on hospitals close to the front lines. UHU paid $5,150 for shipping and $1,250 for processing. The estimated value of the medical supplies shipped is\u00a0<strong>$250,000.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; UHU raised over\u00a0<strong>$14,796<\/strong>\u00a0towards medical treatment and support of wounded Ukrainian warriors. Major recipients are:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/?s=Roman+Kubyshkin\">Roman Kubyshkin<\/a>\u00a0&#8212; $6,035.00 toward rehabilitation treatment;<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wonderful-materialization-united-help-ukraine-activities\/\">Anatoliy Fateiev\u00a0<\/a>&#8212; $2,200 toward purchase of a motoroller;<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/?s=Ruslan+Robert\">Ruslan Robert<\/a>\u00a0&#8212; $2,130 for medical treatment and support; and<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/urgent-heart-surgery-yuri-dudchyk\/\">Yuriy Dudchik<\/a>\u00a0&#8212; $1,020 for heart surgery.<\/p>\n<p>&#x2666; UHU covered \u201cextra luggage\u201d costs and arranged shipping of at least\u00a0<strong>5 suitcases<\/strong>\u00a0of medical supplies with people traveling to Ukraine. Each suitcase contained 50 pounds of medical supplies with monetary value ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 per suitcase. Medical supplies were donated to United Help Ukraine by the Brother\u2019s Brother Foundation.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">&#x2666; United Help Ukraine also started a program entitled &#8220;VETERANSPORT&#8221; and spent $2,250 to send the first group of five paramedic families for\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/winters-tale-carpathians-family-rehabilitation-program-ukrainian-veterans\/\">rehabilitation to the Carpathian Mountains<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Our\u00a0<strong>Defenders Aid<\/strong>\u00a0initiative utilized\u00a0<strong>$14,566<\/strong>\u00a0towards:<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">&#x2666; First aid kit components, including 221 packs of QuikClot and CELOX Z-Folded Gauzes (blood-clotting medicine) and 175 CATs (Combat Application Tourniquets), distributed among various units at the frontlines. Since UHU was established in June 2014, the cumulative total of the first aid kit components includes 300 fully assembled first aid kits, 1,546 packs of QuikClot and CELOX Z-Folded Gauzes, 545 CATs, 500 Israeli Bandages, 5 Tasmanian Tiger First Responder Backpacks, and many other first aid medicines;<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">&#x2666; Purchase of 13 gasoline generators, one gasoline saw and one compressor to be used on the Ukrainian front lines; and,<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">&#x2666; Shipment of over 400 sets of uniforms, 100 pairs of boots and thermal clothing, including underwear, socks, and gloves. Some of these items were donated during our \u201cSocks and Underwear Drive\u201d to provide socks, undergarments and t-shirts to the wounded at Ukrainian hospitals and defenders at the front lines.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Our\u00a0<strong>Humanitarian Aid<\/strong>\u00a0initiative was also very productive, with\u00a0<strong>$8,874<\/strong>\u00a0committed to the following important efforts:<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">&#x2666; We packaged 170 boxes and shipped over\u00a0<strong>6,000 lbs (\u2248 3 tons)<\/strong>\u00a0of clothes, medicine and uniforms. Each box weighed on average of 45lbs and held enough clothes for 4-6 kids or 2-3 adults. We estimated that since the launch of UHU\u2019s humanitarian initiative in September 2015, we have packed a total of 838 boxes and shipped 39,509lbs (\u2248 19.8 tons) of humanitarian aid, thus helping approximately 5,000 people through this initiative.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">&#x2666; In 2016, our shipping expenses were\u00a0<strong>$6,030<\/strong>, bringing the total shipping cost for our humanitarian aid initiative since UHU&#8217;s inception to $29,466.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">&#x2666; Similar to last year, we continued a drive to collect toys and children\u2019s clothes via Amazon.com for Christmas presents to be sent to Ukrainian warriors&#8217; children. We received toy donations valued at over\u00a0<strong>$4,500<\/strong>. The gifts were distributed to children of fallen pilots from Brody, children of Battalion Donbas defenders, children of fallen warriors in the Kyiv region, and to 60 children in the Volyn region whose fathers were killed or missing in action. We are glad to inform you that all gifts were delivered just in time for Christmas and New Year.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">&#x2666; UHU received a donation of a 24-foot truck filled with approximately 14,000 new t-shirts and hoodies. We held two sorting and packing events to pack all these donated items. Because of the support of one generous entrepreneur, UHU shipped the entire container of these t-shirts and hoodies to Ukraine free of charge. T-shirts and hoodies are still being distributed to defenders at the front lines and to the wounded at hospitals.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Our\u00a0<strong>Raising Awareness<\/strong>\u00a0initiative was extremely busy in 2016. UHU hosted or took part in 23 events, fundraisers, and protests. Please see below full list of events.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Finally, we draw your attention to\u00a0<strong>UHU\u2019s administrative costs<\/strong>\u00a0and its continued commitment to operating at a minimum administrative costs margin. UHU\u2019s 2016 administrative and organizational fees totaled $2,046, which included: liability insurance we are required to carry to hold public events, such as concerts and fundraisers; website hosting fees; checks, postage, PO Box annual fee and a tent for UHU fundraisers. A total of $640 of donated funds was used to cover these administrative costs, while UHU membership fees covered the remaining $1,406. This means that UHU&#8217;s operation costs are\u00a0<strong>less than 0.7% of donations<\/strong>\u00a0($640 out of over $88,296 raised in 2016). We want to say a special thank you to our members and numerous volunteers who donate their time and talents to our organization&#8217;s cause.\u00a0<strong>Only because of patriots like you we are able to operate at less than 1% in administrative costs and continue to raise funds and awareness to benefit Ukraine and her brave men and women.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">We sincerely thank every one of you for trusting our judgment and supporting our initiatives during the past year, as well as prior years. It is only with your generous support that we were able to help so many in need during this difficult time. We continue to work only with trusted volunteers, and they are our direct link to recipients of our humanitarian aid. Our recipients are immensely grateful for your support; they are amazed and deeply touched every time they hear that more aid is coming from so far away. It means so much to all of them to know that people who have never met them and who live at such a great distance truly care about them and about Ukraine, and continuously strive to help them.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As we enter 2017, we will continue all of our initiatives starting with the first aid kits which are still a #1 need at the front lines, to the wounded warrior support, and to helping children who have lost a family member in war with Russia in Eastern Ukraine. We strongly believe that every single person can make a difference, whether it is by providing financial support, writing a thank you letter to a soldier defending Ukraine, or by spreading a word of truth about Ukraine and the current situation there. We ask and hope for your continued support of our initiatives in the near future.<\/p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><strong>United Help Ukraine hosted or took part in the following 23 events, fundraisers, and protests in 2016:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>01.\u00a0 02\/19\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/heavenly-hundred-commemoration-charity-concert\/\">Charity Concert to Commemorate the Fallen Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred<\/a><br \/>\n02.\u00a0 03\/09\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/993535464046916:0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rally at the Residence of the Russian Ambassador in support of political prisoners<\/a><br \/>\n03.\u00a0 03\/12\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ukrinform.ua\/rubric-culture\/1981157-ukrainci-ameriki-vsanuvali-202-ricnicu-narodzenna-kobzara.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taras Shevchenko 202 Birthday celebration<\/a><br \/>\n04.\u00a0 03\/19\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1025479860852476\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Easter Bazaar at Holy Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Church<\/a><br \/>\n05.\u00a0 03\/19\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1002340699833059\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pianists for Soldiers: Classical Music Concert<\/a><br \/>\n06.\u00a0 04\/24\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/film-screening-the-resilient-people-of-ukraine\/\">Screening of the movie From Chernobyl to Crimea and Donbas<\/a><br \/>\n07.\u00a0 04\/25\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/charity-fundraiser-at-centreville-united-methodist-church\/\">Charity Dinner fundraiser at Centreville United Methodist Church<\/a><br \/>\n08.\u00a0 06\/05\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1083191755056281\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anychka Charity Concert<\/a><br \/>\n09.\u00a0 06\/09\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/1540020156294673\/permalink\/1551891508440871\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rally at Russian Embassy \u201cFree Russia\u201d<\/a><br \/>\n10.\u00a0 06\/10\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1053437874723341:0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">White House Rally In Support of Security of Poland And Eastern Europe<\/a><br \/>\n11.\u00a0 07\/11\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1095211190546009\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Packing and shipping of over 170 boxes of t-shirts<\/a><br \/>\n12.\u00a0 07\/17\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.golos-ameriki.ru\/a\/mh-17-anniversary-in-dc\/3423138.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Memorial March to Remember Victims of MH17<\/a><br \/>\n13.\u00a0 08\/21\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1104963992904062\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day Festival at Holy Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Church<\/a><br \/>\n14.\u00a0 08\/27\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1107263046007490\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vyshyvanka Run<\/a><br \/>\n15.\u00a0 09\/17\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1126482057418922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Washington Ukrainian Festival in St. Andrew\u2019s Ukrainian church<\/a><br \/>\n16.\u00a0 09\/25\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1138013432932451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turkish Festival to represent Crimean Tatars<\/a><br \/>\n17.\u00a0 10\/15\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1151880861545708\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Volunteering in Insane Inflatables Race<\/a><br \/>\n18.\u00a0 10\/28\/2016\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tamara.rudolph.52\/media_set?set=a.1333451103332203&amp;type=3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ukrainian Embassy &#8211;
