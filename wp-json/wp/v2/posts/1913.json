His long treatment was complicated by the diabetes. Doctors did all they could but were not able to save his legs. A few weeks ago, volunteers from Kyiv contacted United Help Ukraine\u00a0and asked if we could fund remodeling of Ruslan&#8217;s car for hand-controlled operation. In the car adapted specifically for Ruslan, he would be able to move around the city and be independent. The car also required a new set of tires.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"pg-216-8\" class=\"panel-grid\">\n<div id=\"pgc-216-8-0\" class=\"panel-grid-cell\">\n<div id=\"panel-216-8-0-0\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_sow-editor panel-first-child panel-last-child\" data-index=\"12\">\n<div class=\"so-widget-sow-editor so-widget-sow-editor-base\">\n<div class=\"siteorigin-widget-tinymce textwidget\">\n<p>Today, we are happy to report that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unitedhelp.art\/posts\/1231168723616921\" target=\"_blank\">all required work has been completed<\/a>!
