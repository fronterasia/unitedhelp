He had been fighting from the very beginning of the war, and had gone through the hottest points. Last August, near Debaltsevo, he lost both legs. But Angel is one of those people who never give up. \u201cI will return to the front lines and will run so fast I will overtake the Russian tanks while they will be retreating from Ukraine,\u201d says he jokingly.<\/p>\n<p><em>Oleksandr Chekalov, from Lugansk.<\/em> He was among the first volunteer soldiers of battalion &#8220;Aydar\u201c, served as a scout and participated in many military operations that took place in the summer of 2014, starting from the first fighting in Starobilsk, then at Tryokhizbenka, Shchastya, Novoaydar. The man in his fifties, Oleksandr spent the most difficult year in the war. His health deteriorated from living in combat conditions. After the dusty toxic cloud from a mine explosion, that barely missed him and left him coughing for months, he felt it was time to retire from the service at the combat zone and fix his health problems. He has been experiencing digestive problems and, for the last several months, has been suffering from excruciating pain in his legs. Doctors diagnosed arthrosis: \u201cHe had injuries that led to serious diseases, problems with the joints, especially in his knees and hip.\u201c Oleksandr hopes to avoid the surgery with the proper combination of medications and exercise. He urgently requires expensive medical injections and knee braces to treat arthrosis and reduce the pain in his joints.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last Saturday\u2019s concert by three musicians was a storm, a tempest, and a lyrical reverie.
