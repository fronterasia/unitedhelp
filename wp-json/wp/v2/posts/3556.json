Olha lives in Kyiv, she was on the Maidan, and witnessed the events of that winter. We are grateful to Olha for sharing with us her very personal memories. Some people in the audience could not hold back tears while she spoke of the people on Maidan. Perhaps, unwittingly and very naturally, during both her talk and her singing and playing the bandura, Olha was able to convey the spirit of those days and made the audience to relive those moments with her. <\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"1rjdj\" data-offset-key=\"dgi1-0-0\">\n<div class=\"_1mf _1mj\" data-offset-key=\"dgi1-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"dgi1-0-0\">\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\" style=\"text-align: justify;\" data-block=\"true\" data-editor=\"1rjdj\" data-offset-key=\"52k4b-0-0\">\n<div class=\"_1mf _1mj\" data-offset-key=\"52k4b-0-0\"><span data-offset-key=\"52k4b-0-0\">As in the past three years, this year\u2019s charitable event was organized by United Help Ukraine and the Embassy of Ukraine, with proceeds to benefit Ukrainian wounded soldiers.
