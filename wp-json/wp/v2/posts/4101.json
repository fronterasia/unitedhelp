The hospital where Andriy is being treated has invoiced \u20ac10,309 per treatment cycle. At the United Help Ukraine, we decided to add the difference and close the entire account. The funds have already been transferred.<\/p>\n<p>Taking this opportunity, I would like to tell you a little bit about how the UintedHelpUkraine functions.<br \/>\nWe self-organized in 2014, after the Maidan Revolution, when Russia annexed the Crimea and occupied Donetsk and Lugansk. That is why the mission of the UnitedHelpUkraine has been defined as simply as: to assist Ukraine in the war against Russia. In addition to public events and rallies we hold in the US to support Ukraine, we also provide financial assistance. Of course, our resources are limited, so at present we focus mostly on helping Ukrainian warriors and their families in situations where the state is unable to provide additional resources to address the problems of soldiers, war veterans, and their families.<br \/>\nThere are not many of us at the UnitedHelpUkraine, just over a quarter of a hundred. Yet we are active one hundred percent. And we enjoy all the privileges that our organization provides; namely, by being a member one can:<\/p>\n<p>1. Pay the annual UnitedHelpUkraine membership fee.<br \/>\n2. Propose political actions and projects of a pointed assistance to Ukraine.<br \/>\n3. Take part in discussions and vote for the adoption of various projects.<br \/>\n4. Be the first to contribute their personal funds to the agreed project.<br \/>\n5. Ensure that 100% of the money raised is spent on the intended project.<\/p>\n<p>You can also join us with your funds and initiatives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yuri Yankovski: Dear friends, here is our short fundraising report on the treatment of the commander of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army Battalion &#8220;Aratta&#8221;, Andriy Hergert.
