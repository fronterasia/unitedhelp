He was wounded in a terrible accident, lost speech. Doctors in a Zhytomyr hospital saved his life, doctors in the Kyiv region took up to restore functionality of his arms. Valery became the first patient in the clinic who received orthoses made using the 3D scanner. After long months of specialized training, functionality of one of his arms significantly improved.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inna Danchenko, a volunteer at Nodus, remembers how she first met Valery on the eve of 2016. He was slim and exhausted, with no prospects for restoring his speech. His mother was by his site\u00a0when\u00a0suddenly he said, with great difficulty, a single word &#8220;mama&#8221;; \u00a0it was a great joy to everyone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By now, doctors at Nodus had been able to produce the first four orthoses for wounded. Thirty six more wounded soldiers are currently\u00a0in the line expecting treatment. Alexander Kulik, the Director at Nodus, complains that the lack of financial support significantly slows down the process. There are more than three hundred applications from persons who have limbs that do not function properly due to injuries; yet the clinic does not have resources to help them fast enough.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Volunteers are in despair as the wounded young men suffer without adequate help. After wounded soldiers finish the course of surgical treatment in the military hospitals, where surgeons do their best to provide high level medical services, they require an extended course of rehabilitation to continue their recovery. However, the adequate course is not avalable for them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Valery still has long and difficult rehabilitation treatment ahead. Doctors work hard helping to restore health that he lost in the war.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About a year ago, United Help Ukraine, thanks to donation from an anonymous donor, \u00a0was able to purchase the 3D scanner for clinic Nodus.
