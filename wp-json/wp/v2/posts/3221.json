When the war started, he volunteered to the army. Mykhaylo had been fighting from the very beginning of the war and had gone through the hottest points. He was nicknamed Angel because he was always close by when his comrades needed him the most. He was wounded in August, 2015, near the town of Debaltsevo. Mykhaylo lost both legs. But he is one of those people who never give up. \u201cI will return to the front lines and will run so fast I will overtake the Russian tanks while they will be retreating from Ukraine,\u201d says Angel jokingly.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>United Help Ukraine\u00a0raised funds for\u00a0the purchase of two accumulators for wheelchair for Mykhaylo (Angel) Lupeyko.
