The tractor has been in Pervomaiske Village in Eastern Ukraine for over a month now and the planting and growing is in full swing now. We hope that this will bring some relief in the form of jobs and food to the people in the village. May there be a great harvest this year!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thank you to all our generous supporters who have donated for this project.
