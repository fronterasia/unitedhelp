The supplies were delivered to the <strong>Surgical and Intensive Care Departments of the Children&#8217;s Regional Hospital<\/strong>. The donations included various surgical sets, instruments, bandaging, a lot of suture material, patches, laryngoscopes, electrocoagulator, etc. All these medical supplies are absolutely essential for the hospital to have, yet they are expensive and scarce here. The doctors and nurses were totally delighted: if only you could see their faces when they accepted and sorted these gifts! Right away the supplies have been put to use to treat children.<\/p>\n<p>The team of doctors of the Children&#8217;s Regional Hospital, the parents whose children are being treated there, the volunteers of Zaporizhzhya express their gratitude to the Ukrainians of America for their solidarity and assistance in this difficult time for Ukraine!
