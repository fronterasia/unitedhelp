Maryna and Zorik Baydyuk, along with their friends hired a truck and drove all the way from VA to WV and back to VA. Another amazing couple Svitlana and Vlad\u00a0agreed to store all of the boxes in their garage for indefinite time till they are picked up by shipping company.\u00a0All items were individually wrapped, and did not require any sorting, however, we needed to enforce some boxes. So we got together with\u00a0Rodion Iwanczuk, Sveta, Vlad, Tetyana Neeley, Mickey Neeley, Yuliya Murashko and Yura to re-tape the boxes.\u00a0All boxes were picked up by a huge truck, placed into container, and shipped to Ukraine next day. We expect them to arrive by the end of September. There is not enough words to express how much we appreciate help from Vitaliy Ilchishin who was able to arrange free pick up and shipping to Ukraine with help of anonymous shipping company.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1383 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/13879413_1095210277212767_570108169342601748_n-300x225.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/13879413_1095210277212767_570108169342601748_n-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/13879413_1095210277212767_570108169342601748_n-285x214.jpg 285w, https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/13879413_1095210277212767_570108169342601748_n-50x38.jpg 50w, https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/13879413_1095210277212767_570108169342601748_n.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1382 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/13912708_1095210403879421_1766281436674662729_n-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/13912708_1095210403879421_1766281436674662729_n-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/13912708_1095210403879421_1766281436674662729_n-38x50.jpg 38w, https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/13912708_1095210403879421_1766281436674662729_n.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Second shipment of over 170 boxes with approximately 15,000 of NEW and individually packed t-shirts, hoodies and socks is on its way to Ukraine.\u00a0The most amazing part is that this entire project is almost free for UHU but will benefit over 10,000 Ukrainian defenders at front lines and hospitals, their families, and IDP women and<a href=\"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/archives\/1900\">[&#8230;]<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":1380,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[8],"tags":[82],"wppr_data":{"cwp_meta_box_check":"No"},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1900"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1900"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1900\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1902,"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1900\/revisions\/1902"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1380"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1900"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1900"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1900"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
