We were happy and honored that the Ukrainian soldiers, who currently undergo treatment at the Walter Reed National Millitary Medical Center were with us in the audience during that evening.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We would like to thank the pianists for their artful and inspiring performance. Their rendering of the classical music program was lively and energizing, tender and warm, and truly captivating. The program included piano duets by Schubert and solo pieces by Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Liszt, Debussy, and the Ukrainian composer Viktor Kosenko. The performance culminated in a beautiful song, Kosenko&#8217;s Lullaby, sung in Ukrainian by Joanna Jones.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1439 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/12890914_1002338293166633_6480594876734510001_o-300x247.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"247\" srcset=\"https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/12890914_1002338293166633_6480594876734510001_o-300x247.jpg 300w, https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/12890914_1002338293166633_6480594876734510001_o-768x633.jpg 768w, https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/12890914_1002338293166633_6480594876734510001_o-1024x845.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/12890914_1002338293166633_6480594876734510001_o-50x41.jpg 50w, https:\/\/unitedhelp.art\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/12890914_1002338293166633_6480594876734510001_o.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the evening and through ticket sales, UHU was able to raise $3,973!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All proceeds will be split to help wounded Ukrainian soldiers Anatoliy Fateiev and Roman Kubyshkin. Anatoliy Fateiev &#8211; 53 yo., volunteer soldier, sapper. Anatoliy stepped\u00a0on the \u201csurprise\u201d mine while clearing the road for Ukrainian army near Mariinka village in July 2015. He lost both legs. Anatoliy lives in small town Brovary, very close to Kyiv. $2,000 from the proceeds will go to buy a special motorroller to provide more comfortable life for Anatoliy. The remaining funds will be used to support rehabilitation for Roman Kubyshkin. Roman was injured more than a year ago during a deadly fight in Peski on January 22, 2015. He was picked up from the battlefield with the fallen soldiers and taken to morgue. His injuries appeared incompatible with life but his pulse was checked one last time and he turned out to be alive! At first, doctors said he had no chance of survival, but the private neurosciences clinic Nodus started his treatment, and he can even talk a little now.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Team UHU also wants to thank our sponsors, <a class=\"profileLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/buyukrainiancom\/\" data-hovercard=\"\/ajax\/hovercard\/page.php?id=884875791537118\" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show=\"1\">Buy Ukrainian<\/a> and <a class=\"profileLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ukraine-Express-223696924374709\/\" data-hovercard=\"\/ajax\/hovercard\/page.php?id=223696924374709\" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show=\"1\">Ukraine Express<\/a>, Alan I.
