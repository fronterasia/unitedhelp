It was a fun event to be a part of, even though we all had to get up so early in the morning to start at 7 am! UHU provided 22 volunteers for the event. We helped to set up, check people in, monitored various portions of the race, gave out medals and water at the finish line, took inventory and performed many other tasks the organizers needed help with. We are thankful to all who came to help from UHU and the foreign exchange students from ASSE exchange program. We raised $1,362 (volunteering fees and some sales of the sweets at our tent). Our organization will use the money raised for the programs we run to provide aid to Ukrainian people at this difficult time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On October 15th, 2016, United Help Ukraine participated in the Insane Inflatable event in Manassas, VA (Washington, DC suburb).
